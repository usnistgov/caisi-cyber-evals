# We've customized this to push the agent to use the standard bash tool more for

    Interactively drive a bash shell.

    For one-off commands you should prever the standard bash tool, but if you need
    to interact with a program (e.g., by typing input in via the console after it has
    started), this is the tool you should use. For example, if running GDB you could use
    this tool to start the debugger, and then interact with it, responding after you see the
    "(gdb)" prompt.

    This tool will interact with a bash shell by sending it input text and retrieving output
    from it. There is no guarantee that all output will be returned in a
    single call. Call this function multiple times to retrieve additional
    output from the shell.

    USAGE NOTES:
    - Ensure that the shell is at a command prompt (typically when the
        output ends in "$ " or "# ") before submitting a new command.
    - Control characters must be sent as Unicode escape sequences (e.g., use
        "\u0003" for Ctrl+C/ETX, "\u0004" for Ctrl+D/EOT). The literal string
        "Ctrl+C" will not be interpreted as a control character.
    - Use the "read" action to retrieve output from the shell without
        sending any input. This is useful for long-running commands that
        produce output over time. The "read" action will return any new output
        since the last call.
    - If a long-running command is in progress, additional input to execute
        a new command will not be processed until the previous completes. To
        abort a long-running command, use the "interrupt" action:
        `bash_session(action="interrupt")`

    Example use case:
    - Interactive command awaiting more input from the user.
        ```
        bash_session(action="type_submit", input="ssh fred@foo.com") -> "foo.com's password: "
        bash_session(action="type_submit", input="secret") -> "fred@foo.com:~$ "
        ```

    Args:
        action: The action to execute:
            - "type": Send input without a return key
            - "type_submit": Send input followed by a return key
            - "read": Read any new output without sending input
            - "interrupt": Send a Ctrl+C (ETX character) to interrupt the current process
            - "restart": Restart the bash session
        input: The input to send to the shell.
            Required for "type". Optional for "type_submit" actions. Must
            not be provided for "restart", "read", or "interrupt" actions.

    Returns:
        The accumulated output of the shell.
